The axios.post shape
axios.post(url, data, config)

So your line:
axios.post(`${API_URL}/login`, login, { headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } })

maps to:

Position	    What it is	        In your code
1st	            Where to send	    ${API_URL}/login
2nd	            What to send	    login
3rd	            How to send	        headers, options

Now the important part: what is login?
login is frontend state, nothing more, nothing less.
const [login, setLogin] = useState({
  Username: "",
  Password: ""
});

So at runtime, login looks like:
{
  Username: "xyz",
  Password: "abc"
}
That’s it.


What axios does with it

When you pass login as the 2nd parameter:
axios.post("/login", login)

Axios: 
Takes that JS object
Converts it into JSON
Sends it in the request body

So the HTTP request becomes:
POST /login
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "Username": "kuldeep",
  "Password": "12345678"
}

What happens on the backend 

Backend receives request (Express)
Your route: router.post("/login", loginUser)

In your backend controller(Controller runs):
const { Username, Password } = req.body;
req.body is exactly the login object you sent.
req.body === {
  Username: "xyz",
  Password: "abc"
}
This came directly from login state.

Backend logic executes.

Backend sends the response:
return res
  .status(200)
  .cookie("accessToken", accessToken, { httpOnly: true, secure: true })
  .cookie("refreshToken", refreshToken, { httpOnly: true, secure: true })
  .json(
    new ApiResponse(200, {
      user: loggedInUser,
      accessToken,
      refreshToken
    }, "user logged in successfully")
  );


What actually goes back?
HTTP Response body:
{
  "statusCode": 200,
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "_id": "...",
      "Username": "kuldeep",
      "Name": "Kuldeep"
    },
    "accessToken": "eyJhbGciOiJI...",
    "refreshToken": "eyJhbGciOiJI..."
  },
  "message": "user logged in successfully"
}
Plus (important):
Cookies are set automatically by the browser
You do not see cookies in response.data


Frontend receives response 
Axios resolves the promise:
const response = await axios.post(...)

Now:
response.data === {
  statusCode: 200,
  data: {
    user: {...},
    accessToken: "...",
    refreshToken: "..."
  },
  message: "user logged in successfully"
}

So when you do:
console.log(response.data);
You’re seeing exactly what backend sent via .json()
