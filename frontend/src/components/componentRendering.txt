So what does “component renders” actually mean?

Simple definition
Component renders = React calls the component function again.


Imagine this:

function CreatePost() {
  const [file, setFile] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("effect ran");
  }, [file]);

  return (
    <>
      <input type="file" onChange={e => setFile(e.target.files[0])} />
    </>
  );
}

When the app loads
React calls CreatePost()
file = null
JSX is returned
Screen is drawn
useEffect runs

👉 That is the first render

When user selects a file
Step-by-step timeline
onChange fires
setFile(newFile) is called
React schedules an update
React calls CreatePost() again
Now file = newFile
JSX is recalculated
Screen updates if needed
useEffect runs (because file changed)
That second call is a re-render.

Now answer your key questions
❓ Does clicking a button cause render?

Clicking the button itself? ❌ No.
Calling setState inside it? ✅ Yes.

So:

onClick={handleSubmit}
Only causes re-render if handleSubmit calls:
setSomething(...)

❓ Does only that component re-render?
By default: yes.

Only:

the component whose state changed
and its children
Re-render.

Parent and siblings do not re-render unless:
their state/props changed
or parent re-rendered

Visual tree 🌳
App
 ├─ Header
 ├─ CreatePost   ← file state here
 │   └─ Input
 └─ Footer


If file changes in CreatePost:

CreatePost re-renders
Input re-renders
Header ❌
Footer ❌
